title: "FUV Spring 2023 Reading Group: Blockchain and ChatGPT"

This is a **very informal** reading group.

We will learn the basics of Blockchain and ChatGPT.
The main idea is to understand the technologies and implications of them.
That means we will cover certain technical aspects.
High-level impacts have been discussed a lot in the news so we want to see what's
beneath.
The **most optimistic** hope is to innovate and do something novel with these.
Perhaps, talented students would want to take advantage and dream big on this.

Although we hope to learn things, as we are not experts, the meetings could be
messy. At some point, we may have to sit down and read the texts together on the big screen.

## Key information

**Time**: Fridays, 9am-10am

**Place**: CR 502 (except further notices)

**Core members** (responsible to lead):  Tran Vinh Linh, Hieu Nguyen, Minh Doan, Lan Nguyen, Graeme Walker, Truong-Son Van

Everyone who's not a core member is encouraged to lead if they think they can 
do it.


## Materials

We will follow a course on MIT Open Courseware called Blockchain and Money.
All the materials (including reading materials, videos and slides) are available here:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/

The syllabus will be roughly the same but we will go with higher speed (hopefully)
as this is not supposed to be a class but a reading seminar.

A comprehensive book for a course taught on Coursera and at Princeton.
